How to implemet Your Own sizeof
unction implementation cannot be done in C as C doesnâ€™t support function overloading and sizeof()
is supposed to receive parameters of all data types.
#define my_sizeof(type) (char *)(&type+1)-(char*)(&type)
int main()
{
    double x;
    printf("%d", my_sizeof(x));
    getchar();
    return 0;
}
