What are local static variables? What is their use?
Ans:A local static variable is a variable whose lifetime doesn’t end with a function call
 where it is declared. It extends for the lifetime of complete program. All calls to the 
 function share the same copy of local static variables. Static variables can be used 
 to count the number of times a function is called. Also, static variables get the default
 value as 0. For example, the following program prints “0 1”
 
can we return the pointer to a local static variable from a  function ?
Ans: yes we can return the pointer to a local static variable,but the function become non-reentrant.


What are static functions? What is their use?
Ans:In C, functions are global by default. The “static” keyword before a function name makes it static.
 Unlike global functions in C, access to static functions is restricted to the file where they are declared.
 Therefore, when we want to restrict access to functions, we make them static. Another reason for making 
 functions static can be reuse of the same function name in other files.
 
 What is the difference between array and pointer?
 Ans: Behavior of sizeof operator
      though array name is pointer it cannot be assigend with any other address 
	  while a pointer variable can be assigned with the another pointer.
